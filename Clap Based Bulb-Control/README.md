# Clap-Based Bulb Switching System

## Description
A home automation project that allows an AC bulb to be switched ON or OFF using clap sounds detected by a sound sensor and Arduino.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Sound Sensor
- Relay Module
- AC Bulb
- Power Supply

## Working
The sound sensor detects a clap and sends a signal to the Arduino.  
When the sound crosses a defined threshold, the Arduino activates the relay to toggle the bulb.
